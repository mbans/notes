git diff --cached					-	what has been staged
git status -s						-	summary of additions, modifications
git add							-	will add new files as well as adding new content (modifications) to staging area
git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks' 		-	this will commit changes made on your branch WITHOUT the need to add to staging previously
git log							-	view history log
got log --stat						-	log with diffs
git log --pretty=oneline
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"		
git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph			-	shows ASCII based branch merges
git log --oneline --decorate				-	the 'decorate' will show the branch that HEAD is currently pointing to
git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md				-	resets any staged files i.e. reverts
git checkout -- CONTRIBUTING.md				-	discards changed
git remote -v						- 	view your remote servers, origin being the name of the host you CLONED the repo from
git remote show origin					-       inspecting information about remote
git fetch <remote-name>					-	fetches/gets data from remote project, after running fetch you will have reference to all branches from that remote which can be merged
							-	if you 'clone' a remote then git auto adds 'origin' to be an alias for the repo.
								Therefore 'git fetch origin' will fetch new work that been pushed to the server since you cloned it (or last fetched)
git clone <remote>					-	pulls down content and sets up your MASTER branch to track the remote MASTER branch

git branch -vv                                          - Shows local branches and what they are tracking


===============================================================================================
BRANCHING,PUSHING & PULLING
===============================================================================================
git pull                                                -       Fetches data from the server originally cloned and tries to merge into code your working on
git branch testing					-	creates a branch
git checkout testing					-	switches branch, HEAD will point to the new branch

git branch -r						-	show all remote branches
git branch -a						-	showa all local/remote branches
git push origin <remote branch>				-       pushing local changes to the remote branch
							-       the remote branch should be taken from the name provided when you do 									'git branch -a'
								e.g. git push origin feature/myBranch
								
==============
DELETE BRANCH 
==============
git branch -D branch_name                  - Delete local branch 
git push origin --delete <branch_name>     - Delete remote branch
git branch --track branch-name origin/branch-name    - Create a local branch "branch-name" to track remote branch "origin/branch-name"

git remote show origin			- shows all remote/local branches configured for push/pull

git push -u origin feature/PRIME-27742-sdma-exception-management-order       
-- this is used to explicitly push to the remote branch in origin, this will be set thereafter

Commit to wrong branch 		   -  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2941517/how-to-fix-committing-to-the-wrong-git-branch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. To rollback one commit (make sure you note the commit's hash for the next step)
git reset --hard HEAD^					 

2. To pull that commit into a different branch:
git checkout other-branch
git cherry-pick COMMIT-HASH
